## üì± Twilio OTP Verification

This application uses [Twilio Verify](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api) for secure, production-grade OTP (One-Time Password) delivery and validation.

### Twilio Setup

1. **Create a Twilio Account** and a Verify Service.
2. Add the following to your `.env` file:
    ```
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
    TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=your_verify_service_sid
    ```
3. No need to store OTPs in your database‚ÄîTwilio manages code generation, delivery, and expiry.

### How OTP Works

- **Request OTP:**  
  Customers enter their phone number. The backend calls Twilio Verify to send an OTP via SMS.
- **Verify OTP:**  
  Customers enter the received OTP. The backend verifies it with Twilio. If valid, login is successful.
